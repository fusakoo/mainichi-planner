# Mainichi Planner - Frontend
This is the frontend of the app built with React.

## Note
If you'd like to run this app locally, you'd need to create `.env` file in the same directory as this README.md with the following information.
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=
```
Where `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` equal to the backend API server's endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost...`).
It would be best to run the backend with `npm start` then run this frontend with the same command in this current directory.
